The first big rule in sales is that if the person leaves empty-handed, they're likely not going to come back. That's why you have to be somewhat aggressive when you're working with a customer, but you have to make sure you don't overdo it and scare them away.

"Never give someone a chance to say no when selling your product."

One way you can keep a conversation going is to avoid asking questions that have yes or no answers. For example, if you're selling a service plan, don't ever ask "Are you interested in our 3 or 5 year service plan?" Instead, ask "Are you interested in the 3 year service plan or the 5 year plan, which is a better value?" At first glance, they appear to be asking the same thing, and while a customer can still opt out, it's harder for them to opt out of the second question because they have to say more than just "no."
